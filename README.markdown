Proxy Manager for Linux
=======================

Just keep all the files in a folder, and execute

    ./proxy_man.py
    
Make sure you execute it as a ROOT user. Proxy environment variables will be changed in all shells spawned 'after' this script is executed.

If you are using Ubuntu older than version 11.10, you might need to download GTK3 packages.
