Proxy Manager for Linux
=======================

Just keep all the files in a folder, and execute

    python main.py
    
Make sure you execute it as a ROOT user. Proxy environment variables will be
changed in all shells spawned 'after' this script is executed.

If your Ubuntu is 11.04 or older, you might need to download GTK3 packages.
